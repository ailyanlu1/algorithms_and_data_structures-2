1.Why Bloomberg?
2. Given an array of integers, delete the max and min numbers (both could appear
more than once) in place. Do it in O(n) without shifting.
3.Given a function cipher(c) that takes a char and returns it's encryption
(another char), write two functions: one to encrypt a string and one to decrypt
it (takes the encrypted string and returns the original)
4.Given two linked lists that represent two numbers add them. Each node in the
list has a pointer to the next digit and the last digit points to null
5.Nothing too difficult. How to verify a string made from
"{[()]}" is syntactically correct. With each open bracket being closed before
any preceding brackets.

7.Why do you want to work as a software engineer at Bloomberg?
8.Describe a project that you made.
9.What features have you written in Java?
10.Compute the longest group of characters in a given string. (e.g. Given
"aabbbaabaa", the output should be b3, as "bbb" is the longest substring
consisting of the same character in the string.)
